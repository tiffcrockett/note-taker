For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.  Express Note Taker does just that.  The application is plain and simple, and user-friendly. There are three self-explanitory icon style buttons to navigate around the application and two input field areas. 

A pencil icon, when clicked, takes the user cursor to the input area to enter a note title. Note content can be quickly entered with a respoition of the cursur to the area just below the title.  After a note is written, the user clicks a file icon to save the note.  When a note is no longer needed, the use clicks a well-idientified trash can icon to remove the note. Note titles and content are entered into a two-thirds size area in easy to read font and font-size.  Notes are stored in a one-third sidebar. Stored notes are listed by note title, when the title is clicked, the input area is populated with the full note title and content for easy re-reading.
